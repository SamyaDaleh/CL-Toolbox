# CL-Toolbox
A Parsing-as-Deduction system that parses everything and some related tools for educational purposes.

The implementation is based on the slides from Laura Kallmeyer. At the moment it contains:

Parsing as Deduction:
- Top Down for CFG
- Shift Reduce for CFG
- Earley for CFG
- CYK for TAG

It prints out full parsing traces along with applied rules and antecedence items.
Use it to generate examples, play around with grammars etc.

Usage:

I have it as a project in Eclipse and run the Main.java to call the methods I want.

See the test folder for examples of how to use it.
